\section{Details of approaches}

In this section, the details of provenance approach is presented step by step and the corresponding pseudo-code is provided. One key step is to derive the valid view mappings, which depends on checking the satisfiability of {\em schema-level approach} and {\em tuple-level approach} for each candidate view mapping. So we present the details of 
determining view mappings satisfying {\em schema-level approach} in Algorithm \ref{view_mapping_schema_level} and the details of continuing filtering out view mappings violating {\em tuple-level approach} for each individual query tuple in Algorithm \ref{view_mapping_tuple_level}.

 \Input{a set of views: $\mathcal{V} = \{V_1, V_2,...,V_k\}$, user query: $Q$, a Database instance $D$}

 \Output{the set of all covering sets for each tuple in $Q(D)$}

{\em Preprocessing step}: Return a set of view mappings $\mathcal{M}$ and the provenance of $Q$ and each $V$

{\em Reasoning valid view mapping step}: For each query tuple $t$, determine valid view mappings by comparing the provenance of  $Q$ and the provenance of $V$

{\em Covering sets calculation step}: Calculate covering sets based on derived valid view mappings for each query tuple, which will be the output of the algorithm.

Please use readable font sizes in the figures and graphs. Avoid tempering with the correct border values, and the spacing (and format) of both text and captions of the PVLDB format (e.g. captions are bold).

At the end, please check for an overall pleasant layout, e.g. by ensuring a readable and logical positioning of any floating figures and tables. Please also check for any line overflows, which are only allowed in extraordinary circumstances (such as wide formulas or URLs where a line wrap would be counterintuitive).

Use the \texttt{balance} package together with a \texttt{\char'134 balance} command at the end of your document to ensure that the last page has balanced (i.e. same length) columns.
