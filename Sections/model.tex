%view mapping definition

Given a set of possible view mappings, the following step is to check the validity for each view mapping, which is achieved by comparing the provenance between query and views. In this section, we provide the detailed conditions to check valid view mappings. We start exploring the validity conditions by simply considering conjunctive queries and conjunctive views and then extend it to aggregate queries and aggregate views. \eat{can involve reasoning from different perspectives. The conditions for the valid view mappings herein are classified into two types, i.e., {\em Schema-level conditions} and {\em Tuple-level conditions}. }
