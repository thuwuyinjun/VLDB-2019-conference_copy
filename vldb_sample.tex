% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{5} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\begin{abstract}
As research products expand to include structured datasets, 
the challenge arises of how to automatically generate citations to the results of arbitrary queries against such datasets.
%a computational challenge associated with data citation is how to automatically generate citations to arbitrary queries against such datasets.  
Previous work explored this problem in the context of \textit{conjunctive} queries and views %by associating citations to frequent queries, and using these citations to construct citations to general queries 
using a \rbafull\ (\rba).  However, an increasing number of scientific queries are \textit{aggregate}, e.g. statistical summaries of the underlying data, for which the \rba\ cannot be easily extended.  In this paper, we show how a \pbafull\ (\pba) can be leveraged to 1) generate citations to conjunctive as well as aggregate queries and views;  2) associate citations with individual result tuples to enable arbitrary subsets of the result set to be cited (\textit{fine-grained citations}); and 3) be optimized to return citations in \textit{acceptable time}.  Our implementation of \pba\ in ProvCite shows that it not only handles a larger class of queries and views than \rba, but can outperform it when restricted to conjunctive views.

\eat{
Previous work addresses this challenge has been established by us to {\em automatically} construct citations for {\em general} user queries at \textit{various granularity}, which, however, fails to meet the demand of increasing number of aggregate queries with general aggregate functions to extract summary information from large databases. In this paper, we present a provenance-based model (\pba) to solve this problem by leveraging {\em how-provenance}. Despite its challenges to implementing this model at an interactive speed, some optimizations guarantee the feasibility of the implementation which even outperforms the approaches in previous work in some cases and thus indicates its practical use in real world.}
