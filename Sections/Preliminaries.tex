\section{Provenance-Based Model}\label{sec: model}
We now present the model for determining valid view mappings for each query tuple using provenance.
%, which can be used both for conjunctive queries and views, as well as aggregate queries and views. %, which adds more complexity compared to prior work in \cite{wu2018data} due to the aggregate terms in the head of queries and views. 
%We start by introducing some basic concepts
%before presenting validity conditions for view mappings, first for conjunctive queries and then extending them to handle aggregate queries.


\subsection{Basic concepts}\label{Sec: prelim}
\eat{\textbf{Datalog for aggregate query} In this paper, we use an extended version of Datalog called S-Datalog \cite{consens1990low} to represent aggregate queries and aggregate views, which extends standard Datalog by including aggregate terms in the head. Such extended version of Datalog is commonly used in the context of query rewriting using views with aggregation \cite{cohen2006user}\cite{cohen2006rewriting}. Typical example of S-Datalog is presented below.%The formal definition of S-Datalog is presented below.

% \begin{definition}
% {\bf Datalog for aggregate queries}
% %\scream{Daniel: Do we want this syntax? For instance further examples allow to add consitions over aggregate values. Not clear to me what is the precise semantic fragment}
% An aggregate query has the following syntax:
% \begin{tabbing}
% \small
% $Q(X_1, X_2,\dots, X_k, Agg_1(\bar{Y_1}), Agg_2(\bar{Y_2}),\dots, Agg_r(\bar{Y_r})) :-$\=$ B$
% \end{tabbing}
% In the head of $Q$, the attributes $X_1, X_2,\dots, X_k$ are {\em grouping variables}, the attributes in $\bar{Y_1}, \bar{Y_2},\dots, \bar{Y_r}$ are {\em aggregate variables}, and the terms $Agg_1(\bar{Y_1}), Agg_2(\bar{Y_2}),\dots, Agg_r(\bar{Y_r})$ are {\em aggregate terms}.
% \end{definition}

% \begin{example}\label{eg: S-datalog}
% Given a SQL query:

% \begin{tabbing}
% \small
% $q_{\ref{eg: S-datalog}}: SELECT\ $\=$ EID, MAX(Level)\ FROM\ Exon$\\
% % \>$$\\
% \>$WHERE\ TID \geq 2\ GROUP\ BY\ EID$
% % \>$$
% \end{tabbing}
% \noindent
% can be expressed as the following S-Datalog query:
% \begin{tabbing}
% \small
% $q_{\ref{eg: S-datalog}}(E, MAX(L)) :-$\=$ Exon(E, L, T), T \geq 2$
% \end{tabbing}
% \end{example}
In an S-Datalog query, the head terms without {\em aggregate function} belong to {\em grouping variables} (e.g. Variable $T$ in the head of $v_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg1}}$) while other terms with {\em aggregate function} are {\em aggregate terms} (e.g. $COUNT(L)$ in the head of $q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg1}}$, in which $COUNT$ is {\em aggregate function} and $L$ is an {\em aggregate variable}).

% $Q1(B, SUM(D)) :-$\=$ R(A, B, C, D), C \geq 2$
% \end{tabbing}

% \end{example}

% We still use the {\em citation view model} defined by \cite{davidson2017model} and applied by \cite{wu2018data}\cite{alawini2017automating}. In \cite{davidson2017model}, a {\em citation view} is composed of {\em view definition}, {\em citation query} and {\em citation function}, which specify the cited data, the citation information to construct citations and the format of citations respectively. Same as {\em citation view model}, citation views are also optionally {\em parameterized}, where one or more {\em lambda terms} are added to represent a set of {\em instantiated views}.

% Same as \cite{wu2018data}, the core steps toward reasoning about citations is still to build {\em view mappings} from views to queries, check the validity of them for each individual query tuple and then construct citations. The formal definition of {\em view mapping} in the context of aggregate queries and aggregate views is as follows, which is an extension of the {\em view mapping} definition in \cite{wu2018data}.


% \begin{definition}{\bf View Mapping}\label{view_mapping}
% Given a view definition $V$ and query $Q$
% % \begin{center}
% % ${\tt V(\bar{Y}) :- A_1(\bar{Y_1}), A_2(\bar{Y_2}), \dots, A_k(\bar{Y_k}), condition(V)}$\\
% % ${\tt Q(\bar{X}) :- B_1(\bar{X_1}), B_2(\bar{X_2}), \dots, B_m(\bar{X_m}), condition(Q)}$
% % \end{center}

% \noindent
% {\tt $V(Y_1, Y_2,\dots, Y_k, Agg_1(\bar{Y'_{1}}), \dots, Agg_r(\bar{Y'_{r}}))\\ 
% \tab \tab \tab :- A_1, A_2, \dots, A_k, condition(V)$}\\
% {\tt $Q(X_1, X_2,\dots, X_t, Agg_1(\bar{X'_{1}}), \dots, Agg_s(\bar{X'_{s}}))\\
% \tab \tab \tab :- B_1, B_2, \dots, B_m, condition(Q)$}

% a {\bf view mapping} $M$ from $V$ to $Q$ is a tuple
% $(h, \phi)$ in which:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item
%  $h$ is a partial one-to-one function which 1) maps a relational subgoal $A_i$ in $V$\eat{ that uses some variable in $\bar{Y}$} to a relational subgoal $B_j$
%  in $Q$ with the same relation name; and 2) cannot be extended to include more subgoals of $Q$.
%   \eat{
%  $h$ is a one-to-one function which maps each relational subgoal $A_i$ in $V$ that uses some variable in $\bar{Y}$ to a relational subgoal $B_j$
%  in $Q$ with the same relation name.}
%   \item $\phi$ are the variable mappings from  $\bar{Y}' = \cup_{i=1}^{k}\bar{Y_i}$ to
%   $\bar{X}'= \cup_{i=1}^{m}\bar{X_i}$ induced by $h$
% \end{itemize}
% A relational subgoal $B_j$ of $Q$ is {\em covered} iff $h(A_i)=B_j$ for some $i$.
% %\scream{Should this be "a relational subgoal"?  It just said "subgoal" before.}
% A variable $x$ of $Q$ is {\em covered} iff $\phi(y)= x$ for some $y$. Also the variable mapping $\phi$ can be also extended to handle a set of variables. That means, if there exists a set of variables $\bar{y}=\{y_1, y_2,\dots, y_n\}$ from $V$ and a set of variables $\bar{x}=\{x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n\}$ from $Q$ such that $\phi(y_i) = x_i (i=1,2,\dots, n)$, then $\phi(\bar{y}) = \bar{x}$
% \end{definition}

% \begin{example} \label{eg: view_mappings}
% Consider $q_\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}$ and $v_\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}$ in Example \ref{eg: illustrative_eg3} again. We can build one view mapping $M = (h, \phi)$ from $v_\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}$ to $q_\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}$, in which $h=\{Transcript \rightarrow Transcript\}$ while $\phi = \{T \rightarrow Tid, N \rightarrow name, Ty \rightarrow Type, G \rightarrow Gid\}$. Under this view mapping, it is not hard to see that every variable in the head and body of the query is {\em covered}.


% \end{example}

% \textbf{View mappings for aggregate queries} The concept of {\em view mapping} is still used but with some extension due to the existence of aggregate terms in the head of query. We say that an aggregate term $\alpha(\bar{X})$ ($\alpha$ is aggregate function while $\bar{X}$ is the aggregate variables) is {\em covered} by a view mapping $M$ iff all the variables in $\bar(X)$ are 

We start by introducing the basic concepts that will be used in our model.

%To determine the validity of view mappings, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the schema of the query and the schema of the views under the view mappings. Validity also relies on the notions of 1) how-provenance polynomials; and 2) an isomorphism between how-provenance monomials and subgoals, to pave the way to reasoning about {\em valid view mappings} at the tuple level.

\textbf{Granularity of queries and views.} An essential step in determining the validity of a view mapping $M=(h,\phi)$ is to compare the schemas of $Q$ and $V$, and detect whether $V$ keeps all necessary variables in its head. In particular, 
% for every grouping variable of $Q$, $x$, there should exist a grouping variable of $V$, $y$ such that $\phi(y) = x$. which implies that 
if the aggregate view $V$ has the set of grouping variables $\{Y_1, Y_2,\dots, Y_m\}$, then $\{\phi(Y_1), \phi(Y_2), \dots, \phi(Y_m)\}$ should be a superset of the grouping variables of $Q$, $\{X_1, X_2,\dots, X_k\}$. If $\{\phi(Y_1), \phi(Y_2), \dots,$ $\phi(Y_m)\} = \{X_1, X_2,\dots, X_k\}$, we say $Q$ has the {\em same granularity} as $V$. \\ 
Otherwise, if $\{\phi(Y_1), \phi(Y_2), \dots, \phi(Y_m)\} \supsetneq \{X_1, X_2,\dots, X_k\}$, we say $V$ has {\em finer granularity} than $Q$.

\eat{If both have aggregation, %similar to query rewriting using views algorithms,
then $V$ should not project out any necessary columns for $Q$ under a potentially valid view mapping $M$, which implies that for any grouping variable of $Q$, $M$ should map a grouping variable of $V$ to it. In such case, if every grouping variables of $V$ are mapped to grouping variables of $Q$, we say that $Q$ has the {\em same granularity} as $V$. Otherwise, $M$ should map at least one grouping variables of $V$ to non-grouping variables in $Q$, for which we claim that $V$ has {\em finer granularity} than $Q$.}

% \begin{definition}{\bf Granularity of queries and views.}
% Consider the following aggregate query $Q$ and view $V$:

% \noindent
% {\tt $V(Y_1, Y_2,\dots, Y_k, Agg_1(\bar{Y'_{1}}), \dots, Agg_r(\bar{Y'_{r}}))\\ 
% \tab \tab \tab :- A_1, A_2, \dots, A_k, condition(V)$}\\
% {\tt $Q(X_1, X_2,\dots, X_t, Agg_1(\bar{X'_{1}}), \dots, Agg_s(\bar{X'_{s}}))\\
% \tab \tab \tab :- B_1, B_2, \dots, B_m, condition(Q)$}

% Suppose under a view mapping $M = (h, \phi)$ from $V$ to $Q$, for every grouping variable of $Q$, $X_i (i=1,2,\dots,t)$, there exists a grouping variable of $V$, $Y_j (j=1,2,\dots, k)$ such that $\phi(Y_j) = X_i$. 

% 1) If there still exists a grouping variable of $V$, $Y_j (j=1,2,\dots, k)$ such that $\phi(Y_j)$ is not any grouping variable of $Q$, then we say that $Q$ has a {\em coarser granularity} than $V$ (or $V$ has a {\em finer granularity} than $Q$).

% 2) If for every grouping variable of $V$, $Y_j (j=1,2,\dots, k)$ $\phi(Y_j) = X_i$, then we say that $Q$ has the {\em same granularity} as $V$.

% \end{definition}


%\begin{example}
%Consider $Q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}$ and $V_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}$ from Example~\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3} of Section~\ref{ssec:need-provenance}.
%$V_2$ has the {\em same granularity} as $Q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}$ since both $V_2$ and $Q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}$ have one grouping attribute ($Ty$ and $T$ resp.) and $\phi_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}(Ty) = T$. If we remove variable $T$ from the head of $Q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}$, then $V_2$ has {\em finer granularity} than $Q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}$.
%\end{example}

\eat{\begin{example}
Consider $Q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}'$ and $V_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}'$ from Example~\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3} of Section~\ref{ssec:need-provenance}.
$V_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}'$ has {\em finer granularity} than $Q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}'$ since $V_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}'$ has one grouping variable $T$ while $Q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}'$ does not have any grouping attribute. If we add variable $Tid$ into the head of $Q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}'$, then $V_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}'$ has the {\em same granularity} as $Q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}'$ since $\phi_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}'(T) = Tid$.
\end{example}}

\eat{Introduce how-provenance monomials.  Refer to Tables 2-5}
\textbf{How-provenance.} We use the notion of {\em how-provenance} introduced in~\cite{green2007provenance}. It starts by annotating each base relation tuple with a unique {\em provenance token}, and propagates those tokens along with the tuples to the query result.  Each tuple in the query result then has a {\em how-provenance polynomial} expressed using $+$ (alternate use) and $*$ (joint use) to indicate {\em how} base relation tuples contribute to the query result. Each {\em how-provenance polynomial} is composed of multiple {\em how-provenance monomials} which are joint-use terms expressed with $*$. For example, the provenance polynomial for tuple $t_{q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}2}$ in $Q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}(D)$  is $g_2 + g_3$, which has two \textit{how-provenance monomials} (see Table \ref{Table: Sample instance of Q with provenance}). It means that two tuples from relation {\em Gene} with how-provenance tokens $g_2$ and $g_3$, respectively
% , share the same $Tid$ value and 
were used to create $t_{q_{\ref{eg: illustrative_eg3}}2}$.  The $*$ operator is used if there are multiple relational subgoals in the query body, in which case base tuples are {\em jointly used} to create the result.

% \subsection{How-provenance and where-provenance}\label{Sec: provenance intro}


%\textbf{Isomorphism of how-provenance monomials and subgoals.} %Since we need to reason about the \textit{validity} of view mappings using how-provenance, we need to build connections between them, which relies on the fact that how-provenance tokens in the query tuple can be traced back to the corresponding base relation tuples. When the query is evaluated, those base relation tuples are {\em assigned} to relational subgoals which may be involved in view mappings.
%We therefore introduce the notion of {\em assignment}, before defining an {\em isomorphism} between how-provenance monomial and relational subgoals under an assignment.
To simplify reasoning over how-provenance polynomials, \cite{amsterdamer2012provenance} defines a normal form as follows: first, the provenance tokens in each how-provenance monomial preserves the same order as the relational subgoals in the query body. Second, the exponent of every provenance token is forced to be 1. Third, the coefficient of every monomial in a how-provenance polynomial is forced to be 1 by breaking the monomials with coefficient greater than 1 into multiple how-provenance monomials, each corresponding to an {\em assignment} of the query atoms to database tuples.
% \textbf{Assignment} How- and where-provenance are applied to reason about valid view mappings for each individual tuples, which is closely related to the {\em assignment} of base relation tuples to the relational subgoals in the query body. 
% The concept of {\em assignment} originates from \cite{amsterdamer2012provenance} for conjunctive queries and its definition is provided below: 
%\begin{definition}{\bf Assignment. }\cite{amsterdamer2012provenance}
%An assignment $\gamma$ for a (conjunctive or aggregate) query $Q$ with respect to a database instance $D$ is a mapping of the relational subgoals of $Q$ to tuples in $D$ that respects relation names, and induces a mapping over variables/constants.  If a relational subgoal $R(x_1,\dots, x_n)$ is mapped to a tuple $R(a_1, \dots, a_n)$ then we say that $x_i$ is mapped to $a_i$ (denoted as $\gamma(x_1,\dots, x_n) = (a_1, \dots, a_n)$).
% Given a conjunctive query $Q$:
% \begin{tabbing}
% % \tab \tab \tab :- B_1, B_2, \dots, B_m, condition(Q)$}
% % ${\tt Q(\bar{X}) :- B_1(\bar{X_1}), B_2(\bar{X_2}), \dots, B_m(\bar{X_m}), condition(Q)}$
% \noindent
% {\tt $Q(\bar{X}) :- B_1(\bar{X}_1), B_2(\bar{X}_2), \dots, B_m(\bar{X}_m), condition(Q)$}
% \end{tabbing}
% and a database instance $D$, an assignment $\gamma$ is a mapping from one base relation tuple $t_i$ to the corresponding subgoal $B_i(\bar{X}_i)$, denoted as $\gamma(B_i) = t_i (i=1,2,\dots,m)$. Different assignments can lead to different tuples in $Q(D)$ before projection. 
% \end{definition}
% is adapted here to handle aggregate queries and views, which is illustrated using the following example.
% \begin{definition}
% An assignment $\gamma$ of a conjunctive query $Q$
% to a database instance $D$ is a mapping of the relational subgoals of $Q$ to base relation tuples in $D$ that respects relation names and induces
% a mapping over arguments, i.e. if a relational subgoal $R(A_0, ..., A_n)$ is mapped to a tuple $(a_0, ..., a_n)$ then we say that $A_i$ is mapped to $a_i$ (denoted $\gamma(A_i) = a_i$). For a set of arguments and corresponding mapped values, we can also use $\gamma$ to represent such mapping, e.g. $\gamma(A_0, ..., A_n) = (a_0, ..., a_n)$.
% For a tuple $t$ in an aggregate query $Q$, it may be generated by multiple {\em assignment}, denoted $\Gamma = \{\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \dots, \gamma_m\}$
% \end{definition}
%A tuple $t$ in $Q(D)$ may have multiple {\em assignments}, (denoted as $\Gamma = \{\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \dots, \gamma_m\}$), each of which should correspond to one {\em how-provenance monomial}. It is exemplified as below.
%   , that is, a joint-use term in the alternate-use expression.
\begin{example} \label{eg: assignment}
Consider the following query:
\begin{tabbing}
$Q_{\ref{eg: assignment}}(G, G') :- $\=$Transcript(T, N, Ty, G), T >= 2, Ty = Ty',$\\
\>$Transcript(T', N', Ty', G'), T' >= 2$
\end{tabbing}

The provenance-aware query result is shown in Table \ref{Table:Q7(D)} using the instance of {\em Transcript} in Table \ref{Instance of Transcript}. Note that the second and the third monomials for the tuple $t_{q_{\ref{eg: assignment}}1}$ are equivalent but correspond to different assignments, hence written differently ($r_2*r_3$ vs $r_3*r_2$).
Further, the first how-provenance monomial of $t_{q_{\ref{eg: assignment}}1}$ is written as $r_2*r_2$ instead of the compact form ($r_2^2$).  Furthermore, the coefficient of all the monomials in the how-provenance polynomial of $t_{q_{\ref{eg: assignment}}1}$ is 1 rather than grouping them together.
%(although in a more compact form, $r_3*r_4$ and $r_4*r_3$ can be combined into $2*r_3*r_4$ or $2*r_4*r_3$)

% \end{example}

% \begin{example} \label{eg: assignment}
% Suppose we have a query which is a self join on relation Transcript, and retrieves all pairs of gene ids of the same type:
% \begin{tabbing}
% $Q_{\ref{eg: assignment}}'(G, G') :- $\=$Transcript(T, N, Ty, G), T >= 4, Ty = Ty',$\\
% \>$Transcript(T', N', Ty', G'), T' >= 4$
% \end{tabbing}

% The query result along with the how-provenance expression is shown in Table \ref{Table:Q7(D)} using the instance of Transcript in Table \ref{Instance of Transcript}, which includes one query tuple $t_{q_{\ref{eg: assignment}}'1}$ with four how-provenance monomials.
% The instance for $Transcript$ is shown in  and 

\eat{Note that different monomials in $t_{q_{\ref{eg: assignment}}'1}$ reflects the different {\em assignments}.
A tuple $t$ in an aggregate query $Q$ may be generated by multiple {\em assignment}s, denoted $\Gamma = \{\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \dots, \gamma_m\}$. For example, if the aggregate term $COUNT(*)$ is added to the head of $Q_{\ref{eg: assignment}}'$ 
then all four query tuples in Table \ref{Table:Q7(D)} will be aggregated into one tuple.
The result of the modified query, denoted $Q_{\ref{eg: assignment}}''$, is shown in Table \ref{Table:Q10(D)}, and its how-provenance polynomial indicates the four different {\em assignment}s to the resulting query tuple. }
\end{example}


\eat{Isomorphism between how-provenance tokens and subgoals} 
%for single tuple, which can have various forms. 
%Let's start it from conjunctive queries and conjunctive views. For simplicity, we assume that duplicate tuples are not removed in the query instance $Q(D)$ ($Q$ is a conjunctive query) and view instance $V(D)$ ($V$ is a conjunctive view), which implies that the how-provenance polynomial of each tuple in $Q(D)$ or $V(D)$ is a monomial with coefficient 1. 
%An example of query result along with provenance is shown below:

% \begin{example} \label{eg: isomorphism}
% Let's still consider the query $q_{\ref{eg: assignment}}$. Its instance along with the how- and where-provenance is presented in Table \ref{Table:Q7(D)}, which is propagated from the relation $Transcript$ (see Table \ref{Table: Sample instance of Transcript}).

For a query and a result tuple, \cite{amsterdamer2012provenance} defines an \textit{isomorphism} between {\em assignments} and the how-provenance monomials in a query. Borrowing these ideas, we define an isomorphism between relational subgoals and how-provenance monomials under an assignment $\gamma$, which relies on the normal form of how-provenance monomials mentioned previously.

\begin{definition}
{\bf Isomorphism between how-provenance monomials and subgoals.}  Given a conjunctive or aggregate query $Q$ with relational subgoals $B_1, B_2, \dots, B_m$,
\eat{\begin{tabbing}
% \tab \tab \tab :- B_1, B_2, \dots, B_m, condition(Q)$}
% ${\tt Q(\bar{X}) :- B_1(\bar{X_1}), B_2(\bar{X_2}), \dots, B_m(\bar{X_m}), condition(Q)}$
\noindent
{\tt $Q(X_1, X_2,\dots, X_t) :- B_1, B_2, \dots, B_m, condition(Q)$}
\end{tabbing}}
under an assignment $\gamma$, base relation tuples $t_{b1}, t_{b2}, \dots, t_{bm}$ are assigned to relational subgoals $B_1$, $B_2, \dots, B_m$ respectively to generate an output tuple, which can be written as $\gamma(B_i) = t_{bi} (i=1,2,\dots, m)$ \cite{amsterdamer2011provenance}. If tuple $t_{bi}$ is associated with how-provenance token $h_{bi}$, then we say that under the assignment $\gamma$ there is an {\em isomorphism} $F$ between each relational subgoal $B_i$ and each provenance token $h_{bi}$ (call {\em isomorphism under an assignment} for short thereafter), which can be written as: $F(B_i|\gamma) = h_{bi}$ and $F^{-1}(h_{bi}|\gamma) = B_i$.
\end{definition}

% \begin{example}
Returning to Example \ref{eg: assignment}, consider the second provenance monomial $r_2*r_3$ and corresponding {assignment} $\gamma$ in query tuple $t_{q_{\ref{eg: assignment}}1}$ of Table \ref{Table:Q7(D)}. Since $t_{t2}$ and $t_{t3}$ are associated with how-provenance tokens $r_2$ and $r_3$ respectively, there should be an isomorphism $F$ under $\gamma$ such that $F(Transcript(T, N,$ $Ty, G)|\gamma)$ = $r_2$ while $F(Transcript(T', N', Ty', G')|\gamma) = r_3$.
% \end{example}


% For aggregate queries and aggregate views, each tuple in the instance of such query or view should be associated with a how-provenance polynomial with multiple monomials. Each monomial should respect the form of single monomial in conjunctive queries and conjunctive views. Same as \cite{amsterdamer2011provenance}, such entire how-provenance polynomial is written in the form of monomial with the coefficient 1 (if the coefficient is greater than 1, we can break it into multiple monomials with coefficient 1).  

% \begin{example}\label{eg: how-provenance agg}
% We convert $q_{\ref{eg: assignment}}$ to an aggregate query by adding an aggregate term in its head, which is as follows:

% \begin{tabbing}
% $q_{\ref{eg: how-provenance agg}}(G, G', count(*)) :- $\=$Transcript(T, N, Ty, G), Transcript(T', N', Ty', G'),$\\
% \>$Ty = Ty', TID <= 2, TID' <= 2$
% \end{tabbing}

% The instance of $q_{\ref{eg: how-provenance agg}}$ along with how-provenance expression is shown in Table \ref{Table:Q10(D)}. For tuple $t_{q_{\ref{eg: how-provenance agg}}1}$, the how-provenance polynomial of it has four monomials, in which the coefficient of every monomial is forced to be 1. Plus, for each such monomial and corresponding {\em assignment}, the order of how-provenance tokens within it also follows the rules proposed in Example \ref{eg: isomorphism}.

% Recall that one core step to reason about fine-grained citations is to determine valid {\em view mappings} for every query tuple. The concepts provided above pave the way to formalizing the validity conditions for view mappings, which starts by considering conjunctive queries and conjunctive views and extends to aggregate queries and views.
